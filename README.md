# Objective

The objective of this process is to create, from scratch, a basic landing page. The page will be written in HTML and styled with CSS, using Flexbox wherever possible so that it can be practiced.

It will likely not be the most well executed code ever, but that is because this is practice for recently learned material. The idea is to make something that looks generally good on any desktop. At this point there will not be a lot of consideration for mobile, though that may be implemented later on.


# Thanks

Thank you to The Odin Project, for all that it has taught me until this point.
